# task-tracker

#### A simple way to keep track of productivity on large projects 

I created this command-line program to help me stay on target when I was working on a large data entry project. Sure, this could easily be done with a spreadsheet, but why not have a little fun with Python along the way?

## Usage:

• Clone this repository, CD into the correct folder, and run the program with `python task-tracker.py`

• If it's your first time, you'll want to setup a new project with `new project`

• Follow the prompts and give it a name, units of measurement, and a target goal. (e.g. "Catcher in the Rye", "pages", 214) 

• From here you can `enter data` or `show data`. 

• That's it! Enjoy the unlimited powers of productivity and organization.

(NOTE) 

This is by no means a robust database management application, though if you would like, you can easily edit the data.txt file that is created in your project's directory. Just make sure each line is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD: <number>' or you'll get an error.
