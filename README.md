# task-tracker.py

#### A simple way to keep track of productivity on large projects 

I created this command-line program to help me stay on target when I was working on a large data entry project. Sure, this could easily be done with a spreadsheet, but why not have a little fun with Python along the way?

#### Usage

Clone this repository and CD into the correct directory. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed, and run:

`python task-tracker.py`

Task-tracker will ask what you'd like to work on; type `new` if this is your first time.

Follow the prompts to create a new project. As an example use case, say you have a reading goal you want to keep up with:
